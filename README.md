- 📊 **Rapid Release Visibility** - Groups commits by story status and type, making it clear what's ready, what needs attention, and what's incomplete
- ⚡ **Zero Friction Setup** - Just 2 environment variables to start - designed for CI/CD integration and frequent deployments

## 📸 Example Output

View a [sample changelog](example/01-changelog.md) generated by this tool, or see the [live demo on GitHub](https://github.com/Bekind-Labs/tb-changelog/issues/1) to experience how commit hashes become clickable links when posted in releases.

## 📝 Commit Message Format

This tool recognizes Tracker Boot story IDs in commit messages:

```
# Basic format - Associates commit with story (no status change)
[#123456] Add user authentication

# Mark story as finished (all keywords work the same)
[Finishes #123456] Complete login feature
[Fixes #123456] Resolve critical bug
[Fix #123456] Quick patch

# Multiple stories (comma-separated)
[#123456, #123457] Update API endpoints for both features
```

**Supported keywords for marking stories as finished:**  
`Finish`, `Finishes`, `Finished`, `Fix`, `Fixes`, `Fixed` (case-insensitive)

> [!NOTE]
> This format is based on Pivotal Tracker's specifications.  
> Once Tracker Boot officially publishes their git integration specifications, these conventions may change.
